This repo contains information for a short presentation I made about using the `blogdown`-package for Tokyo.R on April 1st 2017.

## open questions
- learn more about HUGO and static site generators
    - more secure than dynamic sites! (Wordpress runs 25% of the web.).
    - improved performance for the end user
    - browsers are maturing!
    - historically: site doesn't need to be updated often
    - shows same content to all users
    - opposite: dynamic site generator
    - seems to be popular since 2012 or so
    - Markdown or reStructuredText are important!
    - performance is important especially for mobile devices
    - static website generation can be a bit tricky, but it's simple with blogdown
    - you need your setup with you (cannot write a few lines from mobile phone e.g.)
- review githubpages
    - it's fast!
    - GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service
    - doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.
    - site should not exceed 1GB
    - often used by jekyll (2008)
        - introduced front matter (YAML-markup)
- HUGO
    - written in go
    - copies any files in static to the build directory
    - it cannot be extended that easily
    - good content model
    - Hugo lets you write front matter in YAML, JSON or TOML.
    - there is really one and only one important but missing feature: the support for R Markdown. That is basically the whole point of the blogdown package.
    - 
- learn about blogdown folder structure
- learn about the detailed workings of setup.sh and deploy.sh

## idea
- add some funny japanese picture?
