# Many reasons to set up a website or blog
- document projects
- contribute to community
- build a portfolio
- practice writing
- learn about web technology

## But it should be simple...
- ... to set up, 
- ... to use and
- ... to publish!

???
Why should you consider a blog?
- web is/ should be about collaboration, freedom and sharing (not surveillance)
- you want to contribute, you need some kind of plattform to do so.
- But it would be nice to be able to share R code with others! 
- I guess, most of us use RStudio for working with R and many of us wil use git and github to control and possibly share our source code. RStudio provides extensive support for literate programming and reproducable research via the `knitr` and `rmarkdown` packages.
- easily contribute to R-bloggers or other blog aggregators

# (Creating a Website locally)
### Install Hugo
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Rstudio/blogdown")
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()  # install Hugo
```

### Create Website
```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_site(theme = "frjo/hugo-theme-zen")  # create website
new_post("tokyo.R", rmd = TRUE)
```

### Build (and publish)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
build_site()
```

???
- Create site needs a empty folder
- explain `options(servr.daemon = TRUE)`
