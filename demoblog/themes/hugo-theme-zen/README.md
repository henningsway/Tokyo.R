## Use Gulp to generate css from sass

Your new Zen theme uses Gulp.js as a task runner, so that it can do many
different tasks automatically:

* Build your CSS from your Sass using libSass and node-sass.
* Add vendor prefixes for the browsers you want to support using Autoprefixer.
* Build a style guide of your components based on the KSS comments in your Sass
source files.
* Lint your Sass using sass-lint.
* Lint your JavaScript using eslint.
* Minify the css.
* Watch all of your files as you develop and re-build everything on the fly.

Set up your front-end development build tools:

1. Install Node.js and npm, the Node.js package manager.

    Detailed instructions are available on the "npm quick start guide":
    https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node/wiki/npm-quick-start-guide

2. The package.json file in your new sub-theme contains the versions of all the
Node.js software you need. To install them run:

        npm install

3. Install the gulp-cli tool globally. Normally, installing a Node.js globally
is not recommended, which is why both Gulp and Grunt have created wrapper
commands that will allow you to run "gulp" or "grunt" from anywhere, while
using the local version of gulp or grunt that is installed in your project.
To install gulp's global wrapper, run:

        npm install -g gulp-cli

5. The default gulp task will build your production minified CSS,
build your style guide, and lint your Sass and JavaScript.
To run the default gulp task, type:

        gulp

    To watch all your files as you develop, type:

        gulp watch

    or just type:

        gulp watch:css
  
    to only watch the css files.
