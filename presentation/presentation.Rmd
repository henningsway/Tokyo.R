# Setting up a website can be easy!
### Many reasons to set up ab website or blog
- document project
- contribute to community

-> Use *Rmarkdown* and publish right from RStudio

### It's simple to set up, 
### simple to use
### and simple to publish

-> `blogdown`-package (Yihui Xie)

???
Why should you consider a blog?
- web is/ should be about collaboration, freedom and sharing (not surveillance)
- you want to contribute, you need some kind of plattform to do so.
- But it would be nice to be able to share R code with others! 
- I guess, most of us use RStudio for working with R and many of us wil use git and github to control and possibly share our source code. RStudio provides extensive support for literate programming and reproducable research via the `knitr` and `rmarkdown` packages.
- easily contribute to R-bloggers or other blog aggregators

# Choose the right tool for the job!
### blogdown

- it's a combination of *HUGO* (static page generator) and <\br> *RMarkdown* (literate programming technology)

- it's very simple to use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install_hugo()
new_post()
build_site
```

# Demo 1: Create a Website locally

![](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/img/SiteTutorial.jpg)

## Install Hugo

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
library(blogdown)
install_hugo  # install Hugo
```
## Create Website

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_site
```
## Select a suitable theme

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_theme
```
## Create a post

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_post
```
## Inspect site

```{r, eval=FALSE}

???
- Create site needs a empty folder

# What i like about `blogdown`!
.pull-left[
### this is great
- very easy to set up
- fast!
- writing blogposts from the comfort of your favorite editor. ;-)
- great variability of easy to install themes, which can be tweaked
- all the features of (html-)rmarkdown can be used and interactive htmlwidgets can be embedded easily
]

.pull-right[
### this is a little strange
- publication to githubpages ist still a bit akward
